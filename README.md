# web application performance testing using JMeter

This report outlines the implementation and comprehensive performance
analysis of a web application designed to emulate the IMDb site from Ama-
zon. The developed system allows users to search for a specific movie ID and
display key details such as writers, directors, publication year, rating, and
actors of the obtained result. The data used is a replica of the original IMDb
database available on the official website. We aim to replicate the functional
behavior of the original website rather than its appearance. Therefore, we
have created a simple interface that allows users to query the aforementioned
database.
